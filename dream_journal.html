            <h2>Spiderman's girlfriend and a turtle tag scene</h2>
            <div class="date"> June 20, 2021</div>
            <div>
              In a large grocery store with self checkouts. They are all full and I am in a big rush with a huge shopping cart full of non-specific items. The lights are all yellow and fluorescent. it feels like an Hmart the 90s. all the shelves are weirdly short- I can see over them. A checker tells me that there’s a special self checkout way in the back through several aisles of goods. Its dimensions are longer than normal so it will help me check out faster. I rush back there.
            </div>
            <div>
              The dream shifts- it is the hey day of Spiderman and we are in a city. Spiderman has a team of people who know his identity and are helping him stay low profile in this climactic moment. He’s about to go on a mission he’ll probably never come back from and we both know it. I am part of his team, a journalist of some kind. Our relationship is a secret. We share an embrace and kiss in a closet, where the rest of his team cannot see. He disappears into the night
            </div>
            <div>
              This dream has a tag scene. I watch an old woman at a single grassy grave site laying flowers. I am the old woman. We cannot see the name on the flat brass name marker but we know that it is Peter Parker. We understood he died the night of the closet kiss. Water washes up near the old woman and there is a turtle. She scoops it up and brings it back to the ocean.
            </div>
            <div>
              The view pans out. This grave site is near a tree on a coastline. There is a quaint cottage. It is near dusk and you can only see the silhouette of cottage and a boy sitting atop the roof. A new story is about to begin. End dream

          <h2>I am told facts</h2>
          <div class="date">June 19, 2022</div>
          <div>
            I had this dream while camping. It was a little cold at night. I wonder if that is the reason didn’t dream visuals. I dreamed words. This has not really happened before.
          </div>
          <div>
            Throughout this dream, people were telling me facts. I remember receiving multiple unrelated facts. The only specific fact I remember is that someone told me that my sister and her boyfriend had to fly back to New York in order to maintain a hybridized marriage license before they would be able to buy an apartment in the city.

          <h2>3 eyed crow and a purse</h2>
          <div class="date">June 12, 2022</div>
          <div>
            I am sitting in a cafe with red chairs, it is bright out and the scene is vaguely European but with a Boba Tea shop vibe. I am sitting, then I get up to leave.
          </div>
          <div>
            I am in a street that is very gray, somewhat narrow and cobblestoned. Think- old school London where buildings are no more than 5 stories tall. I am walking down the middle of the street, there is no one else around but a crow who stands in my path. At first it is a normal sized crow, then i recognize the grow from it’s somewhat poofy domed head. It looks like a crow that lives near me. As this realization dawns on me- the crow grows to the size of a man. I see clearly that it has 3 eyes. the eyes are yellow and appear like vertical slits. The 3rd eye is in the center of its head, just above the beak and slightly above center of the other two eyes.
          </div>
          <div>
            I turn, I know I cannot go past the crow. I walk back a few steps then turn left. I have to go back to the restaurant to get my burgundy red Longchamps bag which I left on a chair at the cafe.

          <h2>purple cloud reprisal and a fart</h2>
          <div class="date">June 11, 2022</div>
          <div>
            I dreamed I took a bus home, then my brother, sister and I were in my sister’s room our parents’ house on her bed. I told them both about dream I had two nights ago about the purple clouds. Then my brother farted such a stinker that I mouth breathed it in and coughed. He denied that he farted and scooted slightly farther away from us on the bed.
          </div>
          <div>
              Throughout the dream, it was understood that my dad and my sister were planning a trip to Mount St.Helens because they wanted to go golfing. I was not convinced it was a good idea.

          <h2>Lisa Frank, Purple Clouds and Gumballs</h2>
          <div class="date">June 10, 2022</div>
          <div>
            I drove my Prius with me and my sister off a cliff on accident but it landed right side up and we were ok. So I grabbed my luggage and tried to repack it but it was too hard because I had to pack for both Chicago and Kauai. Then the world morphed and I was in my sister’s room and some weird dude tried to convince me “stop packing and check out this Lisa Frank poster. Let’s make a game of coloring it in.” The Lisa Frank poster is not super clear but is the kind of poster from the 90s where all the lines are raised fuzzy black  
          </div>
          <div>
            Then somehow my sister and I were trying to escape this weird dude. We were still in a room but it was the size of a ballet studio and the ceiling was a cloud layer and purple lights were pulsing. It was a completely empty room except for at the far end, where our mom’s old wooden wardrobe dresser stood against the wall. We understood if we climbed up into the clouds we’d be safe from the weird dude. My sister made it up the wardrobe into the clouds, I handed her my luggage then I went up but it turned out the clouds only supported one person at a time.
          </div>
          <div>
            I went back down to fight the weird dude. We threw gumballs at each other. Some of them were normal sized but a lot of them were the size of billiards balls. I licked some to make them sticky and gain advantage. The gumball fight eventually turned into a game, we were having too much fun so we made a truce.

          <h2>Sushi Kashiba</h2>
          <div class="date">June 20, 2022</div>
          <div>
            I know I had 3 dreams last night but I cannot remember the first one. I barely remember the 2nd one…. It has completely slipped away. I think it happened in a forest in September. The 3rd one was about scheduling dinner at sushi kashiba.
          </div>
          <div>
            I knew from a friend that sushi kashiba takes reservations for the main restaurant but bar seating is first come first serve. I show up in line to wait. I put my name down on the list. I ask where I am on the list and the server gets mad at me As I am turning to leave, I end up in a back courtyard area with brown wooden folding chairs and small lawn tables. the server shows up again, she has a short  just above the shoulder bob haircut. She tells me that I budged in line and that I was extremely discourteous. Everyone else made reservations so why am I special? I see on her clipboard I am the only person on the waiting list. Turns out, reservations are required for everything and so she thinks I’m insanely rude for just showing up and asking to be seated.
          </div>
          <div>
            It is a misunderstanding. I end up eating with the kitchen staff in this weird backyard courtyard area.
          </div>
          <div>
            The person I am waiting for is late from work. The parking situation downtown is bad and they do not show up- even when a table becomes ready for me.
